This repository features my Bachelor's Degree Final Year Project(FYP) on the development of a predictive model to forecast COVID-19 cases and trends in Malaysia. It utilizes Jupyter Notebook (mainly for data extraction, preprocessing and time series forecasting) along with Tableau for an interactive COVID-19 Dashboard with key features on both predictive and descriptive sections. The main objective of this project is to predict COVID-19 trends by assisting the Malaysian Ministry of Health(MOH) in planning against these outbreaks. 

In summary, FYP1 only focuses on data exploration which provides the general overview of the current situation in Malaysia through apropriate data visualizations. On the ther hand, FYP2 finalizes the overall Final Year Project(FYP) with the successful development of an accurate predictive model and a highly interactive dashboard. If you would like to test out the system yourself, then head on to the FYP2-Finalize folder and read the README_UserManual for instructions to proceed. Alternatively, if you would like to experience a more in-depth analysis on the topic and understand the arduous steps/processes involved then please read the FYP documentation report. Thank you and please do let me know if you would like further clarification.
