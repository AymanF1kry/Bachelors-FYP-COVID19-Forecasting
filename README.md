This repository showcases my **Bachelor's Degree Final Year Project (FYP)** on developing a predictive model to **forecast COVID-19 cases and trends in Malaysia**. The project leverages **Jupyter Notebook** for data extraction, preprocessing, and time series modeling, while **Tableau** powers an interactive dashboard that presents both predictive and descriptive analytics.

🎯 **Objective**: To support the Malaysian Ministry of Health (MOH) in making data-driven decisions to combat future COVID-19 outbreaks by forecasting case trends with actionable insights.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **FYP1-Initiate**  
  Focuses on **data exploration**, providing an overview of Malaysia’s COVID-19 situation using meaningful visualizations and summary statistics.

- **FYP2-Finalize**  
  Contains the **finalized predictive model**, refined data pipeline, and the **Tableau dashboard**. This folder includes the working system and user manual.

- **FYP_Report.pdf**  
  A comprehensive documentation of the entire project — from early exploration (FYP1) to model development and deployment (FYP2). Ideal for understanding the **end-to-end process**.

## 🧠 Key Components

### 🔍 Data Analysis & Preprocessing
- Performed in **Jupyter Notebook**
- Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and time series transformations
- Uses real COVID-19 case data from **KKMNow**

### 🔮 Predictive Modeling
- Compared multiple forecasting models
- Final model selected based on accuracy and interpretability
- Model performance visualized using metrics and plots

### 📊 Interactive Dashboard (Tableau)
- Descriptive Analytics: Trendlines, heatmaps, state-level comparisons
- Predictive Analytics: Projected case trends using the trained model
- Usable by non-technical users (e.g., health officials)
